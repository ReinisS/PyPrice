# PyPrice - A tool for tracking price changes on Amazon.com items

PyPrice lets you add links to Amazon.com items and track their prices overtime. At the click of a single button PyPrice automatically visits each of the previously added Amazon.com pages, loads the contents of the website and finds the price of each given item. Afterwards, the price is saved in a JSON file locally. The gathered datapoints can then be viewed in easy-to-understand graphs.
